# CampusCompass
This app is an application created by Zachary Coon, Shane Rumbaugh, Michael Brink, Andrew Kroner, and Taylor Novotny.

We decided to create this application with the idea that all students on our campus should feel as comfortable as possible when it comes to getting around campus.

Our app is still growing, although the features that are already implemented are listed below:

 - An Interactive Map: Our main feature in the application utilizes the Google Maps API to create a visual aid for users. The map contains    a dropdown list of each building on campus, and upon selecting one the map will drop a marker on that space and zoom into it. It also     contains boundaries so the user can only zoom in so far or so little (to keep user on campus).
 - A Menu: 
 - A Courses List: This is a list of all the courses the user has entered. On top of legal restraints with students actually being able to    link their course schedule from Canvas up to the application, we decided it would be better for the users to be able to enter their        classes in on their own anyway. This feature showcases an *add* button that takes the user to another screen to enter the course          information, and updates the information in the list upon clicking the Courses menu item and returning to the list.
 - An Assignment List: This feature is very similar to the Courses List feature, although slightly different. A list containing each          assignment is also present, as well as an *add* button that takes the user to another screen to enter information. The only major          difference is that a *return* button is located on this screen to take the user back to the updated list, rather than clicking on the      menu to take the user back. 
 - A Profile Information Page: 
 
 [[ Both the Courses and Assignment Lists utilize Database Helpers to store the information locally on the user's device ]]
 
 Although the app has grown considerably in just a short amount of time, we plan on implementing more as time goes on. Some future features that we would like to add are listed below:
 
  - Routing between locations
  - Automatic countdown below the map, telling the user when the next course is starting.
